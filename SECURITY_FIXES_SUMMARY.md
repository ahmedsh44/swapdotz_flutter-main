# Security Fixes Summary

## Problem
The original gifter could still transfer a token after it had been claimed by the receiver, due to:
1. **Stale cached data** being used for ownership checks
2. **Expired transfers** being accepted in "test mode"
3. **Incomplete cleanup** of transfer records after completion

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Force Fresh Data Reads ✅
All critical Firebase reads now use `GetOptions(source: Source.server)` to prevent stale cache issues:

#### Updated Services:
- **`firebase_service.dart`**
  - `getToken()` - Always fetches fresh ownership data
  - `getTransferSession()` - Gets fresh transfer session status
  - `getPendingTransferSessions()` - Gets fresh pending transfers list

- **`secure_transfer_service.dart`**
  - `getPendingTransfer()` - Forces fresh read to check if transfer exists

- **`marketplace_service.dart`**
  - Token ownership verification before listing
  - Check for existing listings

- **`home_screen.dart`**
  - Config checks use fresh data

### 2. Reject Expired Transfers ✅
- **REMOVED** test mode for expired transfers
- Expired transfers are now **ALWAYS REJECTED**
- Clear error message: "This transfer is no longer valid"

### 3. Complete Transfer Cleanup ✅
When a transfer completes:
1. **DELETE** the `pendingTransfers` document (not just mark as COMMITTED)
2. **CANCEL** all legacy `transfer_sessions` for that token
3. **UPDATE** ownership fields atomically

### 4. Enhanced Ownership Checks ✅
- Re-fetch latest token data before **EVERY** ownership decision
- Check both `ownerUid` (primary) and `current_owner_id` (legacy) fields
- Prevent initiating transfers if you don't own the token anymore

### 5. Backend Security Rules ✅
- `firestore.rules`: Allow receivers to read tokens if `pendingTransfer` exists
- `initiateSecureTransfer`: Prevent overwriting COMMITTED transfers
- `finalizeSecureTransfer`: Delete transfer records after completion

## Testing Procedure

### Step 1: Create Fresh Transfer (Gifter)
1. Login as "Gifter" user
2. Scan token as "Gifter" role
3. Create NEW transfer (not expired)
4. See "Transfer initiated" message

### Step 2: Complete Transfer (Receiver)  
1. Login as "Receiver" user
2. Scan SAME token as "Receiver" role
3. Transfer completes successfully
4. Ownership changes to receiver

### Step 3: Verify Original Owner Cannot Re-gift
1. Login back as original "Gifter"
2. Scan token as "Gifter" role
3. Should see "You no longer own this token"
4. **CANNOT initiate new transfer**

## Key Security Principles
1. **Always use fresh data** for security decisions
2. **Never accept expired transfers**
3. **Clean up all transfer records** after completion
4. **Verify ownership before every action**
5. **Use atomic operations** for state changes
