# SwapDotz Seller Verification System

## Overview

The seller verification system ensures authentic transactions by requiring sellers to physically verify ownership with NFC scanning. The **30-day verification window** serves dual purposes: allowing time for NFC verification AND covering the entire shipping/delivery period.

## How It Works

### 1. **Payment Triggers Verification Session**
- When a buyer completes payment for a SwapDot
- A **30-Day Verification Session** is created
- This window covers both verification AND shipping time
- Seller gets notified they need to verify ownership

### 2. **NFC Verification (Immediate)**
- Seller must physically scan the SwapDot with their device
- NFC scan verifies they actually have the token
- System checks the scanned ID matches the sold token
- Only the current owner can successfully verify

### 3. **Shipping & Delivery Period**
- After NFC verification, seller ships the physical SwapDot
- **30-day window covers entire shipping period**
- Allows time for international shipping, customs, delays
- Seller marks transaction complete when buyer confirms receipt

### 4. **Final Ownership Transfer & Payment Release**
- Buyer confirms receipt and takes digital ownership
- **Only then** does payment release to seller (minus 5% platform fee)
- Seller funds are held until buyer confirms receipt
- Physical and digital ownership transfer together
- Transaction marked as completed

## 30-Day Window: Dual Purpose

### üîç **Verification Time (1-7 days typically)**
- Seller scans SwapDot with NFC to prove ownership
- Quick verification process (minutes once started)
- Allows flexibility for seller availability

### üì¶ **Shipping Time (1-30 days total)**
- **Domestic shipping**: 2-7 days
- **International shipping**: 7-21 days
- **Express shipping**: 1-3 days
- **Customs delays**: Additional 1-14 days
- **Rural delivery**: Additional 1-7 days

### ‚è∞ **Timeline Examples**

#### Domestic Sale (USA)
```
