# Refactoring Status

## âœ… Completed

### Files Created
1. **`lib/app.dart`** (120 lines)
   - Extracted MyApp widget
   - Extracted VersionCheckWrapper widget
   - Clean separation of concerns

2. **`lib/main_refactored.dart`** (11 lines)
   - Clean entry point
   - Only handles Firebase initialization
   - Minimal and focused

3. **`lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`** (232 lines)
   - Fully extracted from main.dart
   - Self-contained splash screen logic
   - Ready to use

4. **`lib/screens/celebration_screen.dart`** (656 lines)
   - Fully extracted from main.dart
   - Complete implementation with animations
   - Michael Jordan celebrity example

5. **`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`** (Started)
   - SwapDotzApp class structure created
   - Needs full implementation copied

6. **`lib/services/nfc_service.dart`** (Example)
   - Shows how to extract NFC logic
   - Clean service pattern

7. **`lib/models/token_data.dart`** (Example)
   - Type-safe data model
   - Replaces Map<String, dynamic>

## ðŸš§ Still To Do

### 1. Complete SwapDotzApp Extraction (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Copy lines 1861-3486 from main.dart to home_screen.dart
- This is 1,625 lines of code!
- Includes all NFC logic, UI, and helper methods

### 2. After SwapDotzApp is moved:
- Delete old implementations from main.dart
- Rename main_refactored.dart to main.dart
- Update all imports throughout the project

### 3. Further Refactoring (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Extract LeaderboardScreen to its own file
- Move NFC logic to services/nfc_service.dart
- Create proper error handling service
- Extract constants to utils/constants.dart

## ðŸ“Š Impact

### Before Refactoring:
- **main.dart**: 3,486 lines ðŸ˜±
- Everything in one file
- Hard to maintain

### After Basic Refactoring:
- **main.dart**: ~11 lines âœ¨
- **app.dart**: ~120 lines
- **splash_screen.dart**: ~232 lines
- **celebration_screen.dart**: ~656 lines
- **home_screen.dart**: ~1,625 lines (still big but isolated)

### Total Reduction:
- main.dart reduced by **99.7%**!
- Code properly organized by feature
- Much easier to navigate and maintain

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (10 minutes):
   - Complete copying SwapDotzApp to home_screen.dart
   - Delete the old code from main.dart
   - Test that everything still works

2. **Short Term** (1-2 hours):
   - Extract LeaderboardScreen
   - Move NFC logic to service
   - Create widget folder for reusable components

3. **Long Term** (4-6 hours):
   - Add state management (Provider/Riverpod)
   - Create proper error handling
   - Add unit tests for services

## ðŸš€ Quick Win Command

To see the immediate impact:
```bash
# Count lines before and after
wc -l lib/main.dart
wc -l lib/main_refactored.dart
```

The refactoring is well underway! The biggest remaining task is copying the SwapDotzApp implementation to complete the basic refactoring.
